. [30 marks] The introduction above tells you how to calculate the steady state
temperature at every point on the plate. Discuss at least two possible methods
that you could use to distribute this processing over multiple processors [15
marks], your choice of method [3 marks], and the reasons for your choice [12
marks].

Worksharing:


//——————————————————————
[70 marks] Write a program to implement your chosen method to solve the
given heat diffusion problem in a distributed manner.

i You must fully and explicitly document a detailed description of the
implementation of the method you have chosen, including how the
system was tested. [45 marks]

Scalability metrics: Variance of input measurement on one, and four processors.
How much faster can we solve the problem with 4 processors instead of one?
How much more work can be done with 4 processors instead of 1?

Concluding thoughts:

ii For an implementation using a fixed problem size (size of plate) and
fixed tolerance (specified by the user), calculate the temperature distribution
calculated by (a) a single processor, and (b) four processors.
For both solutions show the calculated temperature distribution as an
image. Comparing the two solutions, calculate the standard deviation of
differences in calculated temperature at each point in the two solutions.
